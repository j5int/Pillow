Follow the steps in winbuild.rst with the following adjustments:
1. If the downloading of the dependencies fails, adjust the requests call to add header to stop it getting blocked as a bot.
2. Install Visual Studio C++ extension for 9.0, 10.0, 12.0 and 14.0 (TBC which are actually required)
3. After running `build_dep.py`, which will fail, - adjust build-deps.cmd batch script with the following:
    - add "set VCTargetsPath=C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\Microsoft.Cpp\v4.0\V140" on line 14
    - change "v7.0" to "v7.1" on line 26 (now 27) for the SetEnv.cmd file
4. And then run build-deps.cmd manually.
